# test_node

In order to run this thing locally you'll have to run several commands on your machine.

- npm install // to get the node_modules folder up and running
- npm run seed // to get some data to work with
- npm run start // to start a server. By default it runs on port 3000, however feel free to pass the port of your preference by typing "PORT={here goes the port}" befor the "npm run start command"
